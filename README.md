# Problems

Problems is a MySQL driven application that returns first world problems from the database

I thought it would be fun to just have an application that would return first world problems randomly at the press of a button.

So I built the database with a few starter problems, as seen in the screenshot
![MySQL db](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mlin2814/firstworldproblems/master/Public/Assets/images/Screenshot%20(17).png)
All of these entries will be returned at some point

But getting all of the problems sequentially is no fun, so that's why the application will return randomized entries.

I mean, truly randomized, as seen by the last entry in the database screenshot!

Here's the simple layout you'll see when using the application

So there you have it! This will be deployed soon to a live site so anyone can use it.

If there are more problems you'd like to add to the database, send it to me for review!
